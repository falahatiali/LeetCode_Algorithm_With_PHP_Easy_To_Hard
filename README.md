# Leetcode questions

I am trying to solve LeetCode algorithm for myself. because always Algorithms are one of my favourite field in computer science.

you can also help me to make algorithms better.

for running this repo if you have composer on your laptop just need to run
```angular2html
composer install
```

and if you don't have composer locally you can also use docker to install it.
in Linux: 

```angular2html
docker run --rm -itd --name composer_locally -v $PWD:/app composer composer install
```
and then look at src folder for problems.
